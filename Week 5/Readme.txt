Professor,

	My apologies for the late assignment. I started a new job this week and was finishing up a lot of projects at my 
last job last week which didn't leave me as much time for schoolwork as usual. I do not say this as an excuse, just for clarification
as to why my assignment is late. I understand you late work policy and fully accept all point loss due to this. I also had a lot of 
trouble in getting Part 1 to runn correctly. I went through and verified my URL paths many time and even opened new projects without 
copying any code from previous ones to help ensure that I had it correct from the instructions, but I always recieved a 404 not page not 
found error. My Code should be in my git location zipped, from which you should be able to see that the code is there and hopefully 
correct.

Regards,
Stephan Moncavage
